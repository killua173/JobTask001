To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:  
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git`  
   `cd your-repository-name`

2. Install all dependencies with:  
   `pip install sqlalchemy pandas numpy scikit-learn fastapi pydantic uvicorn`

3. Ensure you are using Python 3.8.0.

4. After the dependencies are installed, create the necessary database tables by running:
